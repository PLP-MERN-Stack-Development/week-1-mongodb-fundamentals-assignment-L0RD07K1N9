Open a terminal in your project folder

Make sure you have Node.js and the MongoDB Node.js driver installed.
If not, run: npm install mongodb

Start your MongoDB server (if using local MongoDB).

Run the script with Node.js: node queries.js

This will execute all the queries in the file and print the results to your terminal.
